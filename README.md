# Scrollytelling for the Global Dialogues Challenge.

Global Dialogues by CIP, collected responses from thousands of people in over 70 countries around the world. Each with their own distinct languages, religions, and cultural backgrounds. The dataset contains opinions, recurring polls and much more! I built a small web experience to depict the global conversation from the dataset.

A summerized results of polls, and opinions section is provided during the experience!

# How it was built!

I used theater.js, three.js and svelte
